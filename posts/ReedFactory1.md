## How to Start Your Reed Factory
### Part 1: Dial-a-Reed

Every now and then, I'll scrape a reed that turns out to be truly amazing.  Game changing, even.  So good, in fact, that it turns bassoon playing into an act of sheer musical ecstasy.  When this happens, I invariably think to myself, "Ah, good.  You've finally figured out the secret to making a great reed.  Good thing you won't have to learn that again."

Then I'll make 20 more reeds that suck.

Does this happen to any other reed making bassoonist, or is it just me?  Does this frustrate the living @$#@!$# out of anyone else, or do I stand alone, here?  I decided that, for my next few batches of reeds, I was going to shake things up a bit, and see if I could increase my consistency *at all* in churning out a decent reed.  Although I certainly cannot claim to have solved this long standing problem of consistent reeds, I saw enough of an improvement that I thought any fellow bassoon geek might be interested in finding out possible methods that you, too, can use to improve your reed making consistency, and therefore, your bassoon playing satisfaction.

No, none of the methods involve spells, curses, or ancient dances.  Especially curses aimed at trombone players.

**Dust Off That Dial Indicator**

First, just like slow practicing, I had to acknowledge that I already had a tool sitting around that barely got any use.  In this case, that would be my old, trusty-dusty dial indicator.  This is the tool that you stick your reed into, and gently drag the reed to different points so the dial indicator can tell you how thick each part of the blade is - and remind you how terribly you scrape your reed.

Measuring your reeds like this is a tremendous pain in the reed-making-butt.  In the past, measuring never really helped me that much because I had no idea what to do with the measurements.  I didn't know what good measurements were - why should I care about the numbers I'm getting now?  It was like I was a five-year-old with a graphing calculator.  Yeah, I thought it was cool, but the squiggly line on its screen meant absolutely nothing to me.  The result of this was that I gradually forgot about my dial indicator, and spent years making reeds by the seat of my pants.

So, what changed?  What suddenly made the dial indicator relevant?  The difference was that I actually had a couple retired amazing reeds that I had saved.  For some reason, these old guys were awesome, and I was hoping that I could find out exactly what made them that great, so I could reproduce them on future reeds.  Which leads me to my next point:

**Measure a Previous Awesome Reed - Establish a Baseline**

Here's the key, and what makes the dial indicator relevant:  Get good measurements on an existing great reed of yours.  This establishes a baseline against which to compare reeds that you're currently working on.  An important point to this is to get good measurements *in specific places*.  This allows you to measure the same spot each time.  Here's a blank diagram of the points on the reed that I'm measuring these days.

Check out this piece of art work.  This took me an intense ten minutes to put together.  Anyway, you can see from front to back six rows where I measure, with the first four rows containing three spots each.  The numbers in the diagram are purposely blank, so I can experiment with changing and writing in different numbers.  (If you like, click on the reed image for a full-sized version that you can use if you think it would help your own efforts.)

My current numbers are as follows:

- Blade Length: 27-27.5mm
- Blade Width: 13-14mm  (my reeds are skewing a little more toward 13 these days)
- First Row: 0mm back
- Second Row: 2mm back
- Third Row: 5mm back
- Fourth Row: 10mm back
- Fifth Row: 20mm back
- Sixth Row:  Right in front of the collar

As you can see, I measure in smaller intervals up front, since that's where the profile of the scrape tends to be the most complicated and quickly changing.  The further back I go, the less it changes, until the back couple rows I measure just for sheer interest, as I rarely scrape the reed that far back.

**Write Them Down!**

Of course, it goes without saying that taking these measurements does you absolutely no good unless you write them down somewhere!  This set of measurements becomes your standard baseline with which to measure all future reeds against.  I'm guessing yours and my standard measurements will change over time, but this first baseline gives us a good place to start.  The spots you measure may vary.  The point is that you have a standard set of spots that you measure each time.  On both blades!

**Use These Measurements As You Scrape**

So, now we have our baseline measurement, and a new reed that we've just scraped for the first time.  The time has now come to measure it against the baseline.  As I measure each point, if I find that one spot is way too thick, I make a vertical tick with a pencil on the reed at that spot.  If it's just a little thick, I make a horizontal tick.  Once I'm done measuring, I have a rough map on my reed of where I need to scrape.

Once the reed is rescraped, measure it again to see how much each of the points has changed in thickness.  I've found this takes a bit of practice to figure out how much wood I tend to take off each time I scrape.

**What I've Found**

I've been doing this earnestly for a few months, now, and I've discovered a few things about measuring my reeds:

- I had no idea how asymmetrical my reeds were.
- I had no idea how thick the fronts of my reeds were.
- I found I could not "feel" my way to a good scrape.  Running my finger along the blade gave me a good sense of the smoothness of the scrape, but *not* the measurements.
- I rarely scraped the same profile twice.
- Often, when I blew on a reed, I would get the wrong idea about what needed to be scraped, and I would often make the problem worse by scraping the wrong spot.  Measuring the reed first would have given me a much better idea of where the reed was off-kilter.
- Measuring to a specific set of baseline measurements created much much more consistent reeds.
- My odds of getting a new reed that was at least "worth working on" increased dramatically.  For example, my last batch of 12 reeds produced nine reeds that, from the start, approximated the sound and the response that I look for.  Did I get nine amazing reeds out of this? Of course not, but with a pool of nine to start with, and measurements to go by as I broke them in, I got four outstanding reeds.  A couple more show promise, and the others need a little more refining.

For me, this was a huge breakthrough.  As I've aspired to play at the highest level I can, reeds have been a constant thorn in my side.  Figuring out what kind of scrape works, then quantifying and being able to reproduce that has been huge for me.  Without a tool like a dial indicator, I never would have discovered this.  I only wish I would have started using it earlier.

**Stay Tuned**

Using the dial indicator is only a part of my process for churning out a good reed.  Stay tuned for the next part, which chronicles the rest of what I'm doing these days, all in the name of a good @$#@ reed.
