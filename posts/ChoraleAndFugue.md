# Chorale and Fugue in the Dark for Bassoon Quartet

I've finished another new piece for bassoon quartet, this one being for four bassoons. You can leave the contra in its (gigantic) case.

The idea for this came when I was thinking of a previous chorale I had written, "Blueish". I wondered what the opposite of that might be. "Greyish" perhaps?

I wasn't sure what this might sound like until I saw a picture of some old forest at late dusk. Looking at the image, I started thinking about the transition taking place in the picture - an idyllic and relaxing scene where the trees and a breeze blowing through was quickly becoming a scene where those same trees and breeze could take on a more sinister feeling as the darkness of evening descended.

This picture of emotional ambiguity became the idea and central theme of the piece. Although this is not a programmatic piece, you should hear sounds that echo the idea that something that seemed beautiful and relaxing during the day could become creepy and a little scary at night.

The fugue is in 4 parts, whose main theme is a callback to some of the "sound effects" of the chorale. I like to write contrapuntal music, but rarely apply that to the more formal structure of a fugue. Figuring out and managing the jigsaw puzzle of a fugue was an interesting exercise.

Like the majority of my compositions latetly, this was written for my own group, the Boulder Bassoon Quartet.

Take a listen to a demo recording I made of it over on my [Works](/#/works) page, or below.
