## "So So" for Bassoon Quartet Sheet Music Now Available

"So So", the middle movement from my piece, "That So Suite", is now available from TrevCo as a separate purchase. "So So" has a late night jazz waltz feel to it. While still a challenge, it is significantly less difficult than the outer movements of the suite.

If your group isn't ready to play the whole suite, but still wanted to play this movement, here's your chance!

(Of course, the sheet music for the entire suite is also still available from TrevCo! [Pick it up here!](http://www.trevcomusicpublishing.com/shopping-cart?page=shop.product_details&flypage=flypage.pbv.v1.tpl&product_id=1539&category_id=191))
