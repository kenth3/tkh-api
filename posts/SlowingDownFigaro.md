## Slowing Down Figaro

Auditions are a really defining moment for all the hard work you've put in during the preceding months/years in preparation.  In ten minutes or less, you have to convince the panel of judges sitting behind a screen (and most likely making faces at you while eating donuts) that, out of the sixty bassoonists to show up, you are the one they really want to hire.  The others are just hacks.

So, how do you do that?  Simple.  Don't play like a hack.  How do you do that?  Easy.  Just play everything perfectly.  No problem!  And whatever you do, don't mess up the "Marriage of Figaro" excerpt.  If you do, you may as well stop and walk out, because you just sounded like a hack.

I've taken four auditions in the past year, and in two of those auditions, I screwed up the Figaro.  Hundreds of travel dollars, days away from home, months of practice were literally laid waste when I did that.  Frustration would not cover what I felt when that happened.  Here is an excerpt that I thought I could play without any problem at all, and yet, when it really counted, I couldn't.  I decided I'm not going to let that happen again.

Anybody else had that happen?  I think the problem is simple, yet hard to admit:  You never could play it well enough in the first place.  Once you swallow that bitter pill, the solution is equally simple, yet an absolute pain to go through.

**Slow it Down - Find the Problems**

First off, I had to admit that somewhere there was a hiccup in my fingers that was not going to be fixed until I took out my metronome and seriously slowed down the tempo.  The Marriage of Figaro is normally played at roughly a half note equals 138-144 beats per minute (BPM).  I decided to take it all the way down to a _quarter note_ equals 120 BPM, meaning less than half the original speed.  When I began to practice the excerpt at that speed, some funny things started to show up.  (If you're a bassoonist, you may be interested in the problems.  Otherwise, just skip this next list.  Trust me.)

- I realized that coming down from the A in measure 4, that the first finger on my left hand was locked in a half-hole - even after going below E.
- I discovered that going from E to F# (one finger down to all fingers down) sounded extremely sloppy, and that there was often a delay between fingering F# and the note actually speaking.
- C# to D in measure 6 was sloppy.

Finding all of this out was extremely disappointing, but also very helpful.  These details would never have been found at the performance tempo.  So, while I could play the excerpt most of the time, it didn't change the fact that those tendencies were there.  Further, the fact that my problems consisted of the bassoon randomly cutting out while playing were totally explainable by the tendencies I discovered.

My first lesson, then, was simple - you have to start by practicing slowly.

**Play, Curse, Repeat, Play, Curse, Repeat...**

They say knowing is only half the battle.  That certainly applied here.  I knew the problems.  Now, I had to actually fix them.  There's really only one way to fix problems like this:   _Play it very slowly so you can play it correctly, and repeat it._  A lot.  I mean a ton.  Really.  So much that you get sick of it, your neighbors get sick of it, and, from his grave, Mozart himself curses the day he wrote that passage.

It gets better than that.  To really confuse yourself, and make your fingers work even harder, it helps to change the rhythm of the passage you're practicing.  For example, the Figaro consists of straight eighth-notes.  So, to practice, change the eighth notes to dotted-eighth sixteenth figures.  Next, change it to sixteenth dotted-eighth figures.  Finally, play it as written - straight eighth notes.

_(Todo:  find the missing image of this example!)_

One more wrinkle.  Part of learning an excerpt means being able to play it perfectly over and over whenever asked to.  What better way to learn that, than to play it over and over?  It sounds so easy, and yet is so hard to actually pull off.  This requires that you play a rather cruel game with yourself.  I'll explain by telling you what I did.  I decided that I was going to play the excerpt 15 times in a row each day correctly - five times with one rhythm, five times with another, then five times as written.   The rule was that if I screwed up at any time during these repetitions, I would practice that one passage a few times correctly, then I would _start over completely_ from the beginning, and try again to hit 15.

The first day - at quarter note = 120 BPM - it took me a total of 70 or so repetitions to finally get 15 in a row right.  This was the Figaro!  The basic bassoon excerpt!  Something I was supposed to already know!  It was extremely frustrating, and yet, I knew I was finally fixing the problem.

For the next week, I cranked the metronome up one notch each day, and attempted the 15 repetitions.  Each day, it took me between 40 to 80 repetitions to get it right.  One day it took me over 100 times.  The dogs were hiding under the bed by the end.  I wanted to join them.

After two weeks, an amazing thing happened - I simply stopped screwing up.  I suddenly found I could play it not only 15 times in a row, but 30, or 40 - a sure sign that this nasty game of repetition was actually working.  Sweet!

As I write this, I have the metronome back up to a half note = 108, but everything is as smooth as it's ever been, and I can play it at will.  At the end of this week I'll have it back up to full tempo, but only if, each day, I can continue to play it 15 times in a row.  I'm now fairly confident that at the next audition I take in less than three weeks, I won't have to worry about screwing up the Figaro.

**Just the Steps, Please**

"Hey," you say.  "There might be some good information here, but it's in the middle of this long story.  How about just the steps?"

Okay:

1: Admit you have a problem - slow it way down.

- You'll be able to hear your tendencies.
- You can find a tempo slow enough where you can play the passage correctly.

2: Practice it _correctly_ over and over and over.

- Always use the metronome.
- Play different variations on the rhythm.
- Set a goal of how many times you'll play the passage correctly _in a row_.
- If you screw up, go over the problem spot, and - here's the important part - _start over at 1._

3: Raise the tempo one or two notches per day

- Start by playing the passage at yesterday's tempo, then raise it a notch before you tackle Step 2.
- Don't short change this!  Starting slowly and raising the tempo slowly allows you to learn the passage extremely thoroughly.

4: Safety First!  Since frustration is guaranteed to occur, be sure to observe the following.

- Keep all reed knives, mandrels and other sharp objects away from immediate reach.  You will want to use these tools in nasty ways at least once during this process.
- Keep a pillow close by in case the urge to scream uncontrollably hits.  The pillow should muffle this very effectively.
- Old reeds are extremely satisfying to crush against your music stand during a fit of despair.  As a bonus, they are not your good reeds, so there's no guilt or harm in doing so.

**Have Fun, and Don't Break a Reed**

Most musicians are somewhat aware of this process.  I know I've always been.  The problem is that it's a really tedious, time consuming project to undertake practicing like this, and it means admitting that you can't play it.  Neither of those aspects make this very exciting to me.  The amazing thing is, though, that _this method works_ when seriously applied.  It was great to rediscover this myself, and I thought I would pass this along in hopes that someone else might get something out of this.

This is probably the first informational article I've ever posted for the bassoon, or practicing in general.  I hope you find this helpful.  If anybody actually gets to the end of this, and feels like giving feedback, I'd certainly appreciate it.  In the meantime, have fun practicing!
