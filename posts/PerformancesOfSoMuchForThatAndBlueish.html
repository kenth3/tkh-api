<h2>Performances of So Much for That and Blueish</h2>

<p>
    My quartet, the <a href="http://boulderbassoons.com" target="_blank">Boulder Bassoon Quartet</a>, played a concert in Louisville, Colorado last week. The concert featured a couple of my own tunes, including "That So Suite" and the premiere of one of my new pieces, "Blueish". Wanted to share videos of these performances.
</p>
<p>
    Here's our performance of the last movement of the Suite, "So Much for That".

    If you'd like to hear the whole suite: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQgYPxnXjSh3GMpZ0WRDLPTsyEYABTJ-7" target="_blank">here's a playlist of videos to all three movements</a>    
</p>
<p>
    And, finally, in case any quartets out there want to play it, I'll make another plug to <a href="http://www.trevcomusicpublishing.com/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&page=shop.product_details&flypage=flypage.pbv.v1.tpl&product_id=1539&category_id=0" target="_blank">head over to TrevCo and pick up a copy of the sheet music!</a>    
</p>
<p>
    I'm also excited to share the premiere performance of my new very simple chorale, "Blueish".
