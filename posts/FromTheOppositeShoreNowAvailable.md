## New Album "From the Opposite Shore" by the Boulder Bassoon Quartet Released

I'm really excited to announce that the album my group, the Boulder Bassoon Quartet, has been working on this past summer is *finally released!*   This album features new music written and commissioned specifically for the Boulder Bassoon Quartet.

Featured on the album are two of my own works, That So Suite, and Blueish.

It also has the extremely visual and descriptive piece, The Sound of New York, by esteemed composer Dr. Rica Narimoto.

Rounding out the album is, of course, the exciting and driving piece by jazz bassoonist legend Paul Hanson, Bassoon Quartet Number 1.
