# Fanfare for Bassoon Quartet

I've finished a new piece for bassoon quartet, this one specifically 3 bassoons and a contrabassoon.

This is a high energy fanfare with lots of movement, and a build to a rousing conclusion. I even included the word "swashbuckling" as a performance instruction. What could possibly go wrong?

I've always liked the idea of a bassoon quartet being able to pull off a fanfare type of piece. Hopefully this one demonstrates that. It could be a great opener for a concert or recital.

Written for my own group, the Boulder Bassoon Quartet.

Take a listen to a demo recording I made of it over on my [Works](/#/works) page, or below.
