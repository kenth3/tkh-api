## How to Start Your Reed factory
### Part 2: You, Too, Can Be a Journalist

Welcome back to this thrilling and daring series regarding that one subject that people just can't get enough of - bassoon reeds.

Anybody?  Hello?

In the first part of this short series on reed making, I talked about how helpful it was to seriously measure the scrape of your reeds so that, first of all, you know what measurement you're going for, and, second, you know how far off you are from that as you scrape each reed.  (Among other things.)

Now what?  Using a dial indicator certainly helps, but that's not the entire story on getting a "reed factory" going, right?  Well, if it was, I wouldn't be writing another post on the subject.


**Make as Many Reeds at Once That You Possibly Can**

There are two equally good reasons for churning out as many reed blanks as you possibly can.  Trying to prioritize them is impossible, so I won't do that.  Here they are, *in no particular order:*

To do anything well in music, or for that matter, life in general, you have to practice it a lot.  Making a reed blank is no different.  The entire process of making a blank, from shaping the cane to placing the wires just right just to forming the barrel as round as you can to making sure the blades haven't slipped too much to not over tightening the wires to making sure you have a good movie on while working to scoring the back so the lines are perfectly parallel to folding the wood so it's exactly symmetrical to wrapping the thread evenly to...

You get the idea.  There's a lot that could go wrong with a bassoon reed before you ever start to scrape it and attempt to play on it.  The only way to get to the point where those possibilities are minimized is to make so many reeds that you've got the process baked right into your fingers and hands, and you could churn out the same reed blank each time without even thinking (which is good because then you could actually watch the movie that's playing while you're working).  This is important because if you know the blank that you're starting with is made the same way each time, the process of scraping it and breaking it in will progress very similarly each time.

The other reason is simply to increase your odds of making that next great reed.  You're more likely to get four or five great reeds out of a stockpile of fifteen blanks than you are to get them out of six or seven.  It's that simple.  And, since you have to have a great reed to play at your best, you want to give yourself as much of a chance to do that as you can.

There you go.  Four out of five dentists agree:  Make a lot of reeds.

**Identify Each Reed**

Now that you have so many reeds that you can't hardly take a step in your apartment without stepping on one, you have another problem.  They all kind of look alike, don't they?  That's where a good fine point Sharpie comes in.  With pen in hand, you get to identify each reed so you remember which one you worked on.  You can use any identification scheme you can think up, as long as you can always relocate the same reed when you need to.

I use a two part system: the batch date of the reed, and the number of the reed within the batch.  So, if I made a batch of six reeds on September 10, I would number each of them as such: "9/10-1", "9/10-2", "9/10-3", etc.  That's just what I like to use, though.  Whatever works for you is great.

**Journal Your Progress**

>Dear Diary:  Today was such a great day even though it's raining outside.  I made a reed that's round on the bottom, has perfectly aligned blades, and its thread is wrapped so well it's a work of art.  I can't wait to play on it.  I'm just so excited!  It's going to change my life forever!!!!!  Anyway, I have to go watch some TV now, so I'll write again later.  Also, I think Jill likes Tim, but don't tell anyone.

Yeah, that's not what I'm talking about, at all.

What this "journal your progress" idea really means is that you simply log the daily details of breaking in and scraping each reed you're working on. Why is this important?  It allows you to see what methods of yours are helping your reeds and hurting your reeds over time.  Say you get a batch of reeds that turn out especially well.  If you'd been journaling the process of breaking those reeds in, you may find something common that you did to each one of them.

Just like every other step so far, make sure you're journaling the same thing every time.  I like to record a Before and After scenario for each reed.  The "Before" entry would be things like the measurements of each blade, how the reed sounds, what its response is like, and any other detail about it that I think bears noting.  Then I'll scrape the reed, play on it, adjust it a bit, and write the "After" entry - the measurements of the blade, anything else I did to adjust the reed (open the throat, tighten the wires, narrow the reed, etc.), and how it sounds and feels to play on.

I've already noticed patterns showing up in the precess of my reeds breaking in, and I've already made changes to how I'm scraping, and all because I've simply jotted down what I've done, and what happened when I did it.  And to think my professor had been suggesting this for quite a while before I decided to give it a try.  Guess that's why he's the professor and I'm not.

**How Dry Was This Post?**

The simple point to this short series is really thus:  Find out what works, then find out how to reproduce it.  To spell it out a little more specifically:  Measure your best reed, and use that as your baseline.  Make a ton of reeds.  Measure each reed you work on.  Journal your progress.  These steps have really helped me accomplish that.  Double reed players are proud of saying how making reeds is more of an art than a science.  That's true in a lot of ways, but I've been learning just how important the science part really is, and I've noticed a major improvement in the art aspect of my reeds because of it.

Let me just say again that these two posts aren't about me setting myself up as an expert or anything.  The whole point is that I'm learning how to do this, too, and I've found some things that have helped me.  I hope that posting that stuff may actually help somebody else, too.  That's all.  If any bassoonist stops by, and has anything to add to the discussion, or whether you totally disagree with anything, I totally welcome your comments.
